# TI-CC3220S-Thermostat-Project

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Code written for a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S microcontroller which reads room temperature using an I2C peripheral, allows the user to set their desired temperature using the buttons on the microcontroller, lights an LED via GPIO to indicate that the heat is on, and outputs information to the terminal via UART.

What did you do particularly well?

I implemented the task scheduler functionality well in this project.

Where could you improve?

Given more time I could add more functionality, like simulating raising or lowering the room temp incrementally to meet the set temperature and then updating the LED.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The knowledge of how to write code in embedded C, especially the appropriate use of data types. The experience of working with microcontrollers.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The code in this project is organized and readable with appropriate comments. I will be sure to carry that over to future course work.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The use of comments to explain the various sections of code, the use of functions to call certain actions, and the use of task scheduling makes the code in this project organized and understandable.
